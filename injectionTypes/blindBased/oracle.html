<h4 class="subheading">Partial-Blind</h4>

<p>Partial-blind injections can be determined by differing HTTP status codes, response times, content-lengths, and HTML contents in the HTTP response. These markers can indicate true or false statements. The queries below will attempt to exploit the injection
  by asserting a true or false response upon guessed information. True or false queries can also be identified by returning 1(True) or 0(False) rows. An error can also be used to identify 0(False).</p>

      <td>Select COUNT(*) from user_tab_cols where column_name = 'MESSAGE' and table_name = 'LOG_TABLE';</td>

<h4 class="subheading">Converting Partial-Blind queries to Full-Blind queries</h4>
<p>Any of the above queries can be used in full-blind scenarios by using the following conversion: <br/><code>SELECT CASE WHEN (*PARTIAL_BLIND_QUERY*)=1 THEN (SELECT count(*) FROM all_users a, all_users b, all_users c, all_users d) ELSE 0 END FROM dual</code></p>
<p>The partial-blind query must return one row, so always attempt to use COUNT on the column being selected. Add "all_users [letter]" ad naseum until the database response slows. You may need to cycle though [letter] if the database is caching responses.</p>
<h4 class="subheading">Full-Blind</h4>


<p>Full-blind queries do not indicate any result of the query in the HTTP/HTML response. This makes them dependent upon timing functions and other <a class="link" href="{{site.pagebase}}/attackQueries/dataExfiltration">out-of-band methods</a>  for attacks. A true statement will take X seconds to respond, a false statement should return immediately.</p>
