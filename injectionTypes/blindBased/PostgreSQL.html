<p>Partial-blind injections can be determined by differing HTTP status codes, response times, content-lengths, and HTML contents in the HTTP response. These markers can indicate true or false statements. The queries below will attempt to exploit the injection by asserting a true or false response upon guessed
  information. True or false queries can also be identified by returning 1(True) or 0(False) rows. An error can also be used to identify 0(False).</p>
